# Continuous Integration

This is the practice of frequently pushing new changes to the codebase to the repository and having each change verified as working by an automated build and test tool. Github provides hooks for automated build services to watch a repo and trigger a new build/test.

There are several options for testing utilties out there. This provides a nice summary of three of them and of the CI process itself: https://hackernoon.com/continuous-integration-circleci-vs-travis-ci-vs-jenkins-41a1c2bd95f5
